Script that make simple system monitoring and make html page.

## How work?

The need for monitoring a VPS made me create this script;
It monitors the following items that I think are important:

* System info: distribuition, kernel, total packages, Uptime
* Ports services [open] or [down]
* Disk usage
* Packages: Installed, removed and updated (today)
* Top 10 logs size
